# Introduction

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing gene expression profiles at the single-cell level. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of R scripts and workflows for processing and analyzing scRNA-seq data, facilitating the identification of cell populations, exploration of cellular heterogeneity, and discovery of novel biological insights.

# Requirements

To use the scripts and workflows provided in this repository, ensure that you have the following software and packages installed:

R (version >= 3.6)

Bioconductor (for installing bioinformatics packages)

Various R packages (e.g., Seurat, scran, etc.)

High-performance computing resources may be required for large datasets

# Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/kashif415/scRNA-seq.git

# Install required R packages:

install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install(c(ggplot2", "sctransform",
          "devtools", "cowplot", "matrixStats",
          "ggbeeswarm", "ggnewscale", "msigdbr", "bit64", "scater",
          "AnnotationDbi",
          "SingleR", "clusterProfiler", "celldex",
          "dittoSeq", "DelayedArray",
          "DelayedMatrixStats",

          "SummarizedExperiment",
          "slingshot", "batchelor",
          "clustree", "edgeR"))  

Set up your R environment and ensure all required dependencies are installed.

# Usage

To utilize the provided scripts and workflows for scRNA-seq analysis, follow these general steps:

Data Preparation: Prepare your scRNA-seq raw data files (e.g., read count matrices) and associated metadata.

Configuration: Modify configuration files or script parameters to specify file paths, sample information, analysis settings, etc.

Preprocessing: Run preprocessing scripts to filter cells, normalize expression data, identify highly variable genes, and perform batch correction if necessary.

Dimensionality Reduction: Perform dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), or 

Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP).

Clustering: Cluster cells based on their gene expression profiles using algorithms like K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering.

Differential Expression Analysis: Identify differentially expressed genes between clusters or experimental conditions using statistical tests such as Wilcoxon rank-sum test or likelihood ratio test.

Visualization: Visualize analysis results using various plotting techniques including heatmaps, scatterplots, violin plots, and feature plots.
